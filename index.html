<h2>Serving</h2> 
<p>The finsl step before we eat our delicious ham and cheese sandwich is serving. There are multiple ways you can serve your sandwich to make your meal perfect. My personal favorite is to have my sandwich pressed, but this requires a panini press, which you probably dont have at home. A close second is to toast your sandwich in the oven. This helps melt the cheese and warm up the ham. If you prefer a cold sandwich, you can just skip these steps. If you would like, you can even cut your sandwich in half to make it easier to hold! Lastly, you can put your sandwich on your favorite plate, pour some chips, grab a fruit and enjoy! Your AMAZING ham and cheese sandwich is complete!
